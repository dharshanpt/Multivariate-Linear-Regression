# Implementation of Multivariate Linear Regression
## Aim
To write a python program to implement multivariate linear regression and predict the output.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1
<br>Get the independent variable X and dependent variable Y.
### Step2
<br>Calculate the mean of the X -values and the mean of the Y -values.
### Step3
<br>
Find the slope m of the line of best fit. 

### Step4
<br>Use the slope m and the y -intercept to form the equation of the line.
### Step5
<br>
Obtain the straight line equation Y=mX+b and plot the scatterplot.
## Program:
```
```
## Output:

### Insert your output

<br>

## Result
Thus the multivariate linear regression is implemented and predicted the output using python program.
